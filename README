DESCRIPTION
    An OO API to Philippe Verdret's RTF::HTML::Convertor module.

    Define the class variable "CHAT" to have a value if you wish realtime
    output of what's going on.

CONSTRUCTOR new
    Arguments in "key="value> pairs:

    dir:
        the directory to process.

  METHOD process

    Does everything in one method call.

  METHOD get_filenames

    Optional argument is a directory to process: default is in
    "$self-"{dir}> required at construction time.

  METHOD convert_files

    Calls the "RTF::HTML::Converter" (see the RTF::HTML::Converter manpage)
    on every file in our "files" list: takes the filenames from the
    "filename" slot of each hash, and placing the resulting HTML into the
    "html" slot fo each hash.

  METHOD convert_file

    Accepts the object reference and the path to a file to convert. Pushes
    into the object's "files" array a hash with a key "filename" against the
    passed filename, and a key "html" with the value returned by the
    "RTF::HTML::Converter" (see the RTF::HTML::Converter manpage).

    Incidentally returns a reference to the HTML created.

    Does not check to see if the object already contains the processed
    result.

    Does not use the object's "dir" slot.
